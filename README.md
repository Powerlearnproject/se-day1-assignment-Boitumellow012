Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems. It’s important because it ensures software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. 1968: The term "software engineering" was introduced to address the growing complexity of software projects.

2. 1970s: Structured programming and modular design improved how software was built.

3. 2001: The Agile Manifesto changed how teams develop software by focusing on flexibility and collaboration.

### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: Define what the software should do.
2. Design: Plan how the software will work.
3. Implementation: Write the code.
4. Testing: Check for bugs and errors.
5. Deployment: Release the software.
6. Maintenance: Update and fix issues after release.


### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

* Waterfall: A step-by-step method where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Best for projects with clear requirements, like banking systems.

* Agile: A flexible method where small parts of the software are made and tested quickly. Best for apps that need updates often.

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

* Software Developer: Writes the code for the software.
* Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software to find problems.
* Project Manager: Plans and manages the project to make sure it is finished on time.

### Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

* IDEs: Tools like Visual Studio Code help developers write and debug code faster.
* VCS: Tools like Git help teams track changes and collaborate on code.

### What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

* Changing requirements: Use Agile to adapt.
* Technical debt: Regularly clean up code.
* Team collaboration: Use tools like Slack and Jira.

### Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

* Unit Testing: Tests small parts of the code.
* Integration Testing: Checks how different parts work together.
* System Testing: Tests the entire system.
* Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user needs.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


### Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the art of designing clear and specific inputs to get the best results from AI models like GPT. It’s important because good prompts lead to better, more useful responses.

### Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

* Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology.."
* Improved Prompt: "How is AI helping doctors find diseases early? Give examples."
